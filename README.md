## Console Doctrine 2
Before you can use these doctrine commands please make sure you have enabled and configured your [cli-config.php](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/latest/reference/tools.html#configuration) for
doctrine. For a common example see [cli-config.php](cli-config.php) of this repository.

## Console Zend Framework 2

## Generated Classes
At the moment the following classes can be generated:

* ZF2 Form Fieldsets (Collections)
* ZF2 Input Filter

## Known limitations
Unfortunately is it necessary to change some generated code lines by yourself, because some information is currently missing
to make some classes working out of the box.

### Form Fieldsets (Collections)
If you have relations (foreign keys) defined in your entities the `\DoctrineModule\Persistence\ObjectManagerAwareInterface`
must be implemented by yourself. Additionally you must set `property` option for the name of the text which should be
displayed in select box.
